Supplier Cost Optimization Dashboard
🔹 Objective
This project demonstrates how data analytics and cloud tools can uncover supplier consolidation opportunities and potential cost savings in procurement.
📌 Business Problem
Organizations often overspend by working with multiple suppliers in the same category or region. By analyzing procurement data, companies can:
Identify duplicate or overlapping suppliers.
Consolidate spend to gain negotiation leverage.
Achieve 10–15% savings while improving supplier relationships.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy) – Data cleaning & analysis
Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
SQL – Querying procurement datasets
Tableau Public / Looker Studio – Interactive dashboards
Google Cloud BigQuery – Cloud-hosted dataset for live analytics
GitHub – Project documentation & version control
